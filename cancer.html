<h3>Introduction</h3>
LIC’s Cancer Cover is a regular premium payment health insurance plan which provides financial
protection in case the Life Assured is diagnosed with any of the specified Early and/or Major Stage
Cancer during the policy term. 
</br>
The plan offers two benefit options wherein you have the flexibility to choose the type of Sum Insured at
the inception.
<h4>Option I Level Sum Insured:</h4> 
The Basic Sum Insured shall remain unchanged throughout the
policy term.</br>
<h4>Option II Increasing Sum Insured:</h4> 
The Sum Insured increases by 10% of Basic Sum Insured each
year for first five years starting from the first policy anniversary or until the diagnosis of
first event of Cancer, whichever is earlier. On diagnosis of any specified Cancer as
mentioned in Para 1, all the claims shall be based on the Increased Sum Insured at the
policy anniversary coinciding or prior to the diagnosis of the first claim and further
increases to this Sum Insured will not be applicable. </br>
<h4>BENEFITS:</h4>
The following benefits are payable during the policy year under an inforce policy:
A. Early Stage Cancer: Benefits payable on first diagnosis of any one of the specified Early Stage
Cancers, provided the same is admissible are -
(a) Lump sum benefit: 25% of Applicable Sum Insured shall be payable
(b) Premium Waiver Benefit: Premiums for next three policy years or balance policy term
whichever is lower, shall be waived from the policy anniversary coinciding or following
the date of diagnosis. </br>
<h4>WAITING PERIOD:</h4>
A waiting period of 180 days will apply from the date of issuance of policy or date of revival of risk
cover, whichever is later, to the first diagnosis of any stage cancer. “Any stage” here means all
stages of Cancer that occur during the waiting period.
No benefit shall be payable if any stage of Cancer occur before expiry of 180 days from the date of
issuance of policy or date of revival and the policy shall terminate. </br>
<h4>SURVIVAL PERIOD:</h4>
No benefit shall be payable if the Life Assured dies within a period of 7 days from the date of
diagnosis of any of the specified Early Stage Cancer or Major Stage Cancer. The 7 days survival
period includes the date of diagnosis.</br>
